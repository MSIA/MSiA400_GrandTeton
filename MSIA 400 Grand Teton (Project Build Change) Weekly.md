# MSIA 400 Grand Teton (Project Build Change) Weekly Update

## Oct 17 2019

This week our team looked at the project description and laid out a tentative schedule. We decided to analyze the datasets in two approaches. We want to first use classical machine learning algorithms in OpenCV to classify the image files, and then take advantage of deep learning methods to potentially build a more powerful classifier. 

We encountered several problems about the project deliverables:

- How should we incorporate the dataset   "Balanced_Set_Balanced_10000_Generated_9_May_2019.csv” for the OpenCV analysis?

- What approach should we use to generate a list of file names for the  entries in “Balanced_Set_Balanced_10000_Generated_9_May_2019.csv”
