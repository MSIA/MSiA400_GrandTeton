# MSIA 400 Grand Teton (Project Build Change) weekly Update

## Oct 17 2019 WEEK 1

First group meeting on Oct 15 2019, we set up our github team repository and private slack channel. 

This week our team looked at the project description and laid out a tentative schedule regarding how we are going to approach the dataset and deliver the project. We decided to analyze the datasets in two approaches. We want to first use classical machine learning algorithms in OpenCV to classify the image files, and then take advantage of deep learning methods to potentially build a more powerful classifier. 

DON'T USE DEEP LEARNING; USE TRADITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING. 

We encountered several problems about the project deliverables:

- How should we incorporate the dataset   "Balanced_Set_Balanced_10000_Generated_9_May_2019.csv” for the OpenCV analysis?

- What approach should we use to generate a list of file names for the  entries in “Balanced_Set_Balanced_10000_Generated_9_May_2019.csv”

IF THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR ME, THEN PLEASE ASK BORCHULUUN SINCE SHE IS ON TOP WHEN IT COMES TO DATA. IF THESE ARE RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEIR PURPOSE.
